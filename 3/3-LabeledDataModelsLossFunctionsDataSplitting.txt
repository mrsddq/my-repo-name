feature
    features(x)
        one which helps to define an example
            ex: bedroom(3,2,1),city(bengaluru),facing(east|west|north|south)
label
    label(y)
        you will use feature(x) and predict or find the value of label(y)
            ex: price of the 3-bedroom apartment in bengaluru, mg road east facing?
model
    in supervised learning, we use features and labels in training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions from data.
        labeled example:
            time until first engine overhaul
            annual miles driven
            average load weight
            average driving speed
            oil change interval
        unlabeled example:
            time until first engine overhaul
            annual miles driven
            average load weight
            average driving speed
training and loss:
    loss function=(y-y')
        a loss curve plot training loss vs the number of iterations
        a loss curve provides the following hints about training
            a downward slope implies that the model is improving
            an upward slope implies that the model is getting worse
            a flat slope implies that the model has reached convergence
            RSME - root square mean error
        continous training:
            iteration = epoch
            changes in the datasets
            changes in the codes
        overtraining = overtraining
        garbage in, garbage out
splitting data into:
    a 100% data of people taking loan:
        training data - 80%
        test data - 20%
