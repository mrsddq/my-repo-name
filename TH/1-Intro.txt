Introduction to AL/ML

Bits vs Bytes:
A bit is the smallest unit of data in computing, representing a binary value of 0 or 1. A byte consists of 8 bits and is the basic addressable element in many computer architectures, commonly used to represent a single character of text.

f(input) = output

AI: Mimicking the intellignece or behavioural pattern of humans or any other living entitiy

ML: A technique by which a computer can learn from data, without using a complex set of different rules. This approach is mainly based on training a model from datasets.

Deep Learning: A technique to perform machine learning inspired by our brain's own network of neurons.

Define AI/ML
    AI refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.

    ML is an art or science making anything to turn into numbers [0s and 1s], finding the pattern in those numbers.

Using ML to solve real world problem:
    Problem framing:
        Problem framing ensures that an ML approach is a good solution to the problem before beginning to work with data and train a model

        Problem framing is the critical beginning for solving an ML problem.

        Problem framing help us to better understand botht the problem and the data in order to design and build a bridge between them.

        At high level, ML problem framing consists of two distinct steps
            Determining whether ML is the right approach for soving a problem
            Framing the problem in ML terms

Understand the problem:
    Nature of the Application   Expected Features
    =========================   =================              
    eCommerce Application       Suggesting similiar products    Predicting purchasing of item
    Streaming Video Application Suggesting right videos         Predicting user clicks
    Loan Application            Recommending right loan plans   Predicting user to apply loan

Framing an ML problem
    Define the ideal outcome and the model's goal
    Choose the right kind of model
        A classification model's making predictions
        A classification model's output being used in the product code to make a decision
        A regression model making a numeric prediction

    Identify the model's output
    Define the success metrics
